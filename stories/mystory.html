       What do you do on a cold day? You take your {{nouns.get()}} and put in your {{nouns.get()}}.
         Then, very {{adverb.get()}}, mix it with your {{nouns.get()}}s that you got from the {{nouns.get()}}
        and {{verbs.get()}} the mess with your {{nouns.get()}}. Congratulations! You've just made a {{nouns.get()}}!
